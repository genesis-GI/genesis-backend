 In a professional context, I would address the joke you've presented as follows:

"The question 'Why did the chicken cross the road?' is a popular rhetorical question and joke that does not have a specific answer. It serves as an example of colloquial language, used to provoke laughter or amusement in informal settings. The humor is often found in the absurdity of the situation and the unexpected punchline, such as 'to get to the other side'."
